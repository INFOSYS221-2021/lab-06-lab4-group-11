1.What is the type of collection used in the exercise?

(List, queue)

2.What are the different ways of iterating through a collection?

(Use While/while() & For/for() )

3.How do you find out the size of a collection?

return queue.length

4.How do you add an item to a collection? What happens if you try to add an item to a collection that is already full?

(use collectionName .add()? Would the code not work after that?)

5.How do you remove an item to a collection? What happens if you try to remove an item that does not exist in the collection?

(would it be like, collectionName .remove()? when item doesnt exist, the remove function will not do anything i guess?)

6.Change the implementation of a FIFO queue to a LIFO queue in 5.6.1.

(good luck)
